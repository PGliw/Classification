# Text classification - alghoritms comprasion.
Project for machine learning classes at university.  
Subject: *Systems analysis and decision support methods in Computer Science.*
___
### Overview
The lecturers implemented unit tests and other files. The task was to implement missing machine learning alghoritms in content.py file, using only numpy library.  
* to see results, run main.py script,
* to read more about Naive Bayes visit [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier),
* to read more about k-NN visit (no surprise...) [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm).

### Goal:
Classify each text into one of four topic-related groups based of words present in the text.  
Since we assume that words in one text are unrelated the algorithm is called *Naive Bayes*.  
In case of *k-NN alghoritm* we measure the distance as the number of words that two text differ by.
___
### Results
As the result of main.py you should see a buch of charts comparing the tested parameters and alghoritms.
